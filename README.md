# Insertion and external sorting for databases

The program contains functions to insert, store and sort data of Record type, without using sophisticated data structures such as B+ trees or hashing. The external sorting algorithm used is applicable even for big data, provided that they are stored in the specified format.

Developed and maintained by D.Gounaris and D.Christodoulou for an assignment during Implementation of Database Management Systems semester course.
